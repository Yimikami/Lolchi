## Deployment on Cloudflare Workers

With the introduction of `worker.js`, you can now deploy Lolchi on Cloudflare Workers without the need for a traditional server setup.

[Credits to BangingHeads](https://hextechdocs.dev/using-cloudflare-workers-to-make-api-calls/)

If you prefer not to use the Cloudflare Worker script, you can find the old `server.js` and `riot.ts` files in the `OLD_FILES` directory.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Set up a Cloudflare Workers account**: If you don't have one, sign up at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
2. **Deploy the Worker**:
   - Use the Cloudflare dashboard or Wrangler CLI to deploy your `worker.js` file.
   - Ensure your environment variables are set up correctly in the Cloudflare dashboard.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

### CORS Configuration

For development purposes, you can set `const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["*"];` in `worker.js` to allow all origins. However, for production deployment, it's recommended to specify your own domain to enhance security.

```javascript
// Example for development
const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["*"];

// Example for production
const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["https://yourdomain.com"];
```
